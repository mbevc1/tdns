# tdns CLI

A powerful, lightweight CLI to manage Technitium DNS server via HTTP API endpoint.

> [!WARNING]
`tnds` is not supporting full set of API calls yet and only the ones I initially
needed :smile: Contributions are welcome and feel free to check the upstream
guide or open an issue/PR!

> [!NOTE]
Full list of API docs and spec is available [here](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer/blob/master/APIDOCS.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
Because this is the initial (v0) iteration of the CLI, some features maight
change and the code quality will improve over time (e.g. tests, re-use, ...).

## Installing

1. Download from the [releases](https://github.com/mbevc1/tdns/releases)
2. Run `tdns -v` to check if it's working correctly.
3. Enjoy!

## Usage and üõ† Setup

Generate a config file with:

```bash
tdns init
```

Or manually create `config.json` or `~/.tdns/config.json`:

```json
{
  "token": "your-api-token",
  "host": "http://localhost:5380"
}
```

> [!TIP]
You can also use:
- `--token` (`-t`) and `--endpoint` (`-e`) flags
- Environment variable: `TDNS_API_TOKEN`

## Building and üß™ Dev

If you want to build your own binarly locally, you can do that by running:

```shell
make build
```

Which should produce a locally binary to run.

> [!NOTE]
You'll need Golang compiler and Make.

To run tests there is a Makefile target for that as well:

```shell
make test
```
